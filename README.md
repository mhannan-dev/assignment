## Installation Process

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects:

- git clone https://github.com/mhannan-dev/onesttech-assignment.git
- cd onesttech-assignment
- composer update
- save as .env.example to .env
- add database credential in .env file
- Run php artisan key:generate
- Run php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
- Run php artisan serve
- Go to link localhost:8000 OR 127.0.0.1:8000
